# Algorithms-Princeton
Solutions to programming assignments to the course Algorithms, Part I by Kevin Wayne and Robert Sedgewick of the Princeton University.
Algorithms, Part 1 covers elementary data structures, sorting and searching algorithms. 
The following algorithms are covered in part 1:
* Union-Find
* Stacks
* Queues
* Elementary sorts (Insertion sort, Selection sort, Shellsort)
* Merge sort 
* Quick sort
* Priority Queues (Binary heaps, heapsort)
* Symbol Tables (Binary Search Trees)
* Balanced Search Trees (Red-Black BSTs, 2-3 trees, B-Trees)
* Hash Tables
* Applications
